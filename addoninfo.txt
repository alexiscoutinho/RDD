	addonDescription	"Death's Door with the Realism made by Valve.

This addon simply merges the latest development version of Death's Door (in this mutation: incapacitation is disabled, you die instead; medkits and adrenalines are converted to pain pills; the heartbeat sound plays when under 25% health and B&W applies when at 1 perm HP; survivors are rewarded for reaching/resting in the safe room instead of 'rewarded' for dying, which now results in 24 perm + 26 temp HP in the next chapter, by having 80% of their missing health to 50% healed [the medkit heals 80% of the missing health to 100%]; defibrillators actually do what their name implies by giving 1 perm + 99 temp HP instead of curing players to 50 perm HP; and Fallen Survivors drop defibs instead of medkits) with the difficulties of the classic Realism mode.

Death's Door was created by Rayman1103 and has been recently improved with contributions from Jack Bauer ︻デ▬——.
